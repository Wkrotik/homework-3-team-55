            <h2>More Details</h2>
            <p> The “Hour of Code” event was an exciting opportunity for secondary school students from school number 57 to explore the world of programming for the first time. Designed for beginners, the event introduced participants to essential programming concepts such as algorithms, conditional statements, and loops. Through engaging tasks from the “Classic Maze” compilation, students practiced solving problems by combining logical blocks to create functional algorithms.
                
                Despite having no prior coding experience, participants enthusiastically tackled the challenges, experimenting with different solutions and asking insightful questions. The team began by explaining the basics of the first few tasks and then encouraged participants to progress independently, offering guidance when needed. By the end of the session, all students successfully completed the tasks, gaining valuable problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
                
                The event also included a motivational speech about ADA University, fostering excitement about the field of Information Technology. Each participant received a certificate upon completion, celebrating their achievement and hard work.
                
                In summary, the “Hour of Code” was a resounding success, igniting interest in programming and equipping students with foundational coding skills in a fun and engaging environment.</p>
