            <h2>About Us</h2>
           
            <p>Welcome to our webpage! We are Team 55 from ADA University, students of the School of IT and Engineering (SITE). We are a group of curious and motivated learners exploring the art of web development. Our team name, RA2M, is special to us. It’s a blend of our initials—Rubaba, Aykhan, Arhan and Mubariz—and also stands for Random Access Analog Memory, reflecting our tech-focused majors and creative approach to problem-solving.</p>

            <p>This webpage is part of a fun learning project where we’re practicing how to design and build websites. It’s our first attempt, and we’re excited to put our ideas into action and create something engaging and useful.</p>
                
            <p>We chose the name RA2M because it represents both who we are and how we work. Inspired by the concept of memory, it reflects our ability to store, process, and share ideas while adapting to challenges. For us, RA2M isn’t just a name—it’s a statement of how we aim to leave a lasting impact through collaboration and innovation.</p>
                
            <p>Thank you for visiting our page! We hope you enjoy exploring what we’ve created as much as we’ve enjoyed making it.</p>
