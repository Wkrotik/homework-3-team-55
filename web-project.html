            <h2>Info about the web project</h2>
            <p>In this project we have built a website which consists
                of 6 pages with the following names: About Us, Hour of Code, 
                Code Artist, Team Members, Logic Gates, and, the one you are currently
                at, Web Project! On this page we are going to describe briefly each
                another page, what it is in general and what it includes. 
            </p>
            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>This page gives a brief description about our team and this project.
                It includes a paragraph that introduces the user to our web-site and
                has 2 more sections: Our Projects and Our team. In "Our Projects" 
                section, it has links to our previously made projects, which include 
                "Logic Gates on Breadboard" and "Hour of Code". These links lead to
                the pages Logic Gates and Hour of Code accordingly. In the "Our Team"
                section, there is a link below to the page Team Members and a group 
                photo of our team. This page is the initial page but can be also
                reentered to by clicking on our team's logo in the top left corner.
            </p>
            <h3>Hour of Code</h3>
            <p>This page includes description about the Hour of Code event our team
                has conducted with a group of children from a school that doesnt teach
                programming. It starts firstly by introducing 2 cards that give a brief
                description about what the event is and how it was organized. Then it
                presents photos made during that event as event highlights. And at the 
                bottom of the page, there are extra details about the whole event.  
            </p>
            <h3>Code Artist</h3>
            <p>This page represents the skill of drawing a picture using solely javascript
                code. In this case, the Brawl Stars logo was attempted to be recreated, and
                it successfully did so. There is a button below the canvas that, when clicked,
                commands the website to draw the Logo in the real time and the button disappers.
                The user can see the process of drawing in the real time. After the image has
                been drawn, the button appears again with another text that lets the user to
                clear the image from the canvas and then they can draw it again by clicking the
                updated button again.
            </p>
            <h3>Team Members</h3>
            <p>This page introduces the user to our team, with photos labeled with our names
                and a brief description about each of us.
            </p>
            <h3>Logic Gates</h3>
            <p>This page presents our project of creation of logic gates, which includes images of
                NOR and AND gates that were created by our Team in a laboratory.
            </p>
            <h3>Other info about the web site</h3>
            <p>At the top-bar you can click on the "Toggle Theme" button to switch between light and
                dark modes. The button right from it includes a menu button that lets the user access
                any page besides the About Us page.
